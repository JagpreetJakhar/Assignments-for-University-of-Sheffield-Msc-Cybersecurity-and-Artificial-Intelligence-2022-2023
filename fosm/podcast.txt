 Indicate what social engineering is:
Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation and influence to deceive people into divulging sensitive information or
 performing actions that may not be in their best interest.

• give illustrative examples of social engineering approaches:
One reason social engineering is so effective is because it plays on common human tendencies, such as the desire to be helpful or the fear 
of missing out 
on something. For example, an email claiming to be from a bank, saying that the victim's account has been compromised 
and asking  them to click on a link to "verify their account." The victim, feeling a sense of urgency and wanting to protect their account, 
may click on the link without realizing that it is a phishing attack

Another reason social engineering is effective is because it often relies on impersonation or deception. Cybercriminals may create fake websites
 or social media called Pretexting:
profiles in order to appear legitimate, or they may pretend to be someone they are not in order to gain the victim's trust.
 This can be especially effective when the attacker is able to provide convincing details or seems to have insider knowledge.


Baiting: This is a tactic in which a cybercriminal offers the victim something desirable, such as a prize or reward, 
in exchange for sensitive information or access to a system.

Scareware: This is a tactic in which a cybercriminal presents the victim with a fake warning, 
such as a message claiming that their computer is infected with a virus, in order to trick them into downloading malware or paying 
for unnecessary software.

Quid pro quo: This is a tactic in which a cybercriminal offers the victim something in exchange for sensitive information or access to a system.
 For example, an attacker might offer to fix a computer problem in exchange for the victim's login credentials.

• highlight why social engineering is so effective:

Overall, social engineering attacks can be highly effective because they target the human element of security rather than technical vulnerabilities..
• explain what needs to be done or what could be done to counter it:

Use technical controls such as spam filters and firewalls to block suspicious emails and prevent unauthorized 
access to systems.

Verify the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information

Use strong and unique passwords: 

Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments: 

• give an indication of how you see the future of social engineering evolving:

 increasing use of social media and messaging platforms as a way to conduct 
social engineering attacks. 
 the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate and scale 
social engineering attacks to create more sophisticated and targeted attacks,
 or to automate the process of sending large numbers of phishing emails or messages.
